Today is the day. After an intensive period of four years, writing this note of thanks is the finishing touch to my thesis. It concludes an era of intense growth, not only in the scientific area, but also on a personal level. The work put into this thesis had a big impact on me and I would like to reflect on the people who have supported and helped me throughout this period. 

I would first like to thank my promotor Jorgen D'Hondt, who was the first professor I spoke when choosing an education and who introduced me to particle physics. He gave me the opportunity and motivation to conduct my research for which I will always be grateful. Furthermore I would like to acknowledge the people that have helped improve this research and thesis. The feedback from the TOP PAG conveners, Rebecca, Pedro, and Maria,  as well as the members of the analysis review committee Bob, Alexander, and Yuan Chao, was highly appreciated. I would also like to thank the members of the jury for reading the thesis and the valuable discussion during the private defence. Their input and comments helped making this work of titans a masterpiece to be proud of. Throughout my research, Rebecca  has always supported me and has become a personal friend. Her constant enthusiasm about research and life inspires me still and for this I am thankful. 

I was lucky to meet different people with various cultural backgrounds during my journey in particle physics. I feel enriched by all my encounters and am happy for the opportunities the collaborations have brought. At our corner at the IIHE, there was a sanctuary for anyone and I can honestly say that this experience wouldn't have been the same without my office-friends. Thank you to Simon (and Joni) and Doug for making everyone fat from eating cake and biscuits. Quentin, your background musical sounds will never be forgotten.  Gerrit, James, Taejong, Nadir, Natalie, Annik, Petra, Shimaa, Giannis, Seth, Jarne, Dom, Emil, and Kirill. You are all wonderful people and I wish you all you could hope for. I want to also especially thank Denys who, though he has joined our office later in time, I could always lean on. 

My journey has always been together with two special persons, Kevin and Lieselotte. We have followed the same path for a third of our life. Sharing victories and defeat together, and I look forward to keep on sharing life's journey with you. Isabelle has joined later, and together with Lieselotte we have become the tracker girls. Our journeys to CERN will always be close to my heart. I cherish the moments we shared and will continue to share as we make our way in life.

My gratitude goes also out to my other amazing colleagues at the IIHE. Thank you, Marleen, for your spirit and guiding us through the administrative maze of the VUB. Olivier, remember, we will always be your ``kindjes'' and if you miss us, I can always come coding next to you. I know you (and I) cherish those quality moments. Romain, Samir, Shkelzen, Abdel (Jr. and Sr.), and Stephane. Your personal en technical support is highly appreciated and was vital for the good outcome of my journey. 


Also the Silicon Strip Tracker Group will always have a special place in my heart. Thank you Erik for showing me the other side of experimental physics and taking us to places that most people dream of: the heart of CMS! Ferdinando, Christian, Derek, and Francesco, you are the people that made CERN trips so amazing and wonderful to do. I wish you all the best in your future endeavours and hope our paths will cross again down the line. 


I would also like to thank my mother, brothers and sister for their wise counsel and sympathetic ear. You are always there for me. Finally, there are my not-working-in-physics friends. Thank you for always being there though I have not always been available to return the favour. The knowledge of having a supporting team is a treasure that cannot be taken away. 

Frank, thank you for the support and dealing with my craziness. You and Balou are the only wolf pack one could need.
