After the requirements on the events, explained in \Chap{chap:5}, to enhance the signal rate. The events are classified into five statistically independent regions: \STSR, \TTSR, \WZCR, \STCR, and \TTCR, shown in \tab{tab:regions}. In both signal regions (\STSR\ and \TTSR), no clear background discriminating variables were found and a multivariate technique was chosen. In this search, it was opted to use boosted decision trees. BDTs and neural networks are the two TMVA methods achieving the best separation for analyses were the signal and background distributions have overlap. Using a BDT has as advantage that it is a relatively fast method, it is easy to understand and has an excellent efficiency. In particle physics, using a  BDT is the most common used approach. 

In \Sec{sec:templates}, the construction of the BDTs in the \STSR\ and \TTCR\ is explained. In each regiona set of discriminnating variables is defined for each coupling, and BDTs are trained in each three-lepton channel separatly. In the \WZCR, a discriminating variable between the \WZ+jets and \NPL\ background is found, this variable is presented in \Sec{sec:mtw}. The influence systematic uncertainties, introduced in \Chap{chap:4}, on the templates are investigated and the results are discussed in \Sec{sec:sys}. The analysis strategy and the global fit is validated on pseudo-data. This validation is explained in \Sec{sec:val}. After the validation, the fit is performed on the actual data and the results are shown in \Sec{sec:Result}. One dimensional and two-dimensional limits are extracted and presented in \Sec{sec:limits}.


\section{Construction of the BDT template distributions}
\label{sec:templates}
There were no selection criteria found to make a clear rejection of the background events without sacrificing a significant amount of signal. For this reason, a multivariate approach using Boosted Decision Trees that combines several discriminating variables in the TMVA framework is used. For the training, the BDTs are trained against all backgrounds.  The \NPL\ background is not taken into account for the training since it is limited in statistics and would cause overtraining. The BDT settings  avoid over-training and  maintain a good discriminating power against the backgrounds. The background and signal yields follow the relative fractions predicted by the simulation. 

Starting from a large set of possible discriminating variables, a minimal set of variables is chosen based on the ROC curves. For each coupling, involving an up or charm quark, and each signal region, a minimal set of variables in constructed. Since for the \Zut\ and \Zct\ coupling, for example, the expected b tag information will behave differently, as well as the fact the charm coupling will have more similarities with the \SM\ tZq process, different trainings with different input variables are performed for each coupling. Furthermore, the different three-lepton channels are trained individually, keeping the same input variables. The input variables do not depend on flavour and are therefore kept the same. However, to account for possible discrepancies between the muon and electron, the training is done seperatly for each three-lepton channel. In \Sec{sec:BDTSTSRZUT}, the construction of the multivariate discriminating variable in the \STSR, for the \Zut\ interaction, is shown. The construction of the multivariate discriminating variable in the \TTSR\ for this interaction is shown in \Sec{sec:BDTTTSRZUT}. For the \Zct\ interaction, these are shown in \Sec{sec:BDTSTSRZUT} and \Sec{sec:BDTTTSRZUT} respectively. 

\subsection{BDT training in the \STSR\ for the \Zut\ interaction}
\label{sec:BDTSTSRZUT}
Since the single top quark signal is expected to have an enhanced discrimination against the background processes compared to the top quark pair signal,  the BDT is trained solely on the single top quark signal.  The variables used to reconstruct the multivariate discriminator are chosen based on the differences expected between signal and background. For the \STSR, the main backgrounds are the \SM\ tZq and \WZ+jets processes,  The \WZ+jets process does not contain a top quark, while for the \SM\ tZq, there the reconstructed \SM\ top quark can lose energy via the radiated \PZ\ boson.  The pseudorapidity of the SM top $\eta(\mathrm{SM top})$ as well as the invariant mass of the lepton arising from the \PW\ boson $\mathrm{l}_{\PW}$ and the \SM\ b, are used as discriminating variables. The distribution of the  pseudorapidity of the SM top peaks at zero for the FCNC single top quark signal, while the peak is broader for the background contributions. The invariant mass of the lepton arising from the \PW\ boson and the \SM\ b jet peaks at around 100~\GeV\ for signal and background, where the distribution of the background processes has a broader tail. Additionally, the difference in $\phi$ between the W lepton and the SM b jet $\Delta \phi(\Plepton_{\PW},b)$ peaks around $\pm 1$ for signal, while for background this is at $\pm 3$. Indicating that for background the  W lepton and the SM b jet are not necessarily coming from the same object. The is also visible in the distribution of the difference in the distance in the $\phi\eta$-plane $\Delta R(\Plepton_{\PW},b)$, between the W lepton and the SM b jet, where signal is peaking at lower values. For signal, the lepton assigned to the \PW\ boson should not be close to the \PZ\ boson in the transverse plane, this is used by looking at the difference in  $\Delta R$ between the W lepton and the Z boson $\Delta R(Z,\Plepton_{\PW})$, which peaks at large values for the signal distribution. For the  background processes these peak are not as present. For the signal, the jet with the highest transverse momentum is expected to be the b jet. The CSVv2 discriminant of the jet with the highest \pt\ (CSVv2 jet $\pt^{\mathrm{max}}$) is used as discriminating variable, peaking at one for the signal process. Since the up quark is a valence quark for the proton, while the anti-up quark is a sea quark, one expects a charge asymmetry. This effect is exploited by using 
the charge of the W lepton times the absolute pseudorapidity of the W lepton ($|\eta(\Plepton_{\PW})|\times Q(\Plepton_{\PW})$) and  the \pt\ of the W lepton times its charge ($\pt(\Plepton_{\PW})\times Q(\Plepton_{\PW})$) as discriminating variables. The distributions of the variables are shown in \fig{fig:singletopZutnormalised} for the  \mumumu\ lepton channel, the other distributions for the individual three-lepton channels can be found in \App{app:BDTcorrZutSing}. The correlations between the different variables are shown in \fig{fig:correlationsigzutsingletop}. The correlation between the variables varies from zero to $\sim 60\%$. The most discriminating variable is the distance in the $\phi\eta$-plane between the \PW\ lepton and the SM b jet, followed by the CSVv2 discriminator of the jet with the highest \pt. On third place is the invariant mass of the sum of the \PW\ lepton and \SM\ b jet.

The resulting multivariate discriminator D is shown in \fig{fig:sigvsbkgtestzutsingletop} for all three-lepton channels. In these plots one can see that there is a clear discrimination between the FCNC single top quark signal and the backgrounds. Furthermore, one can investigate the procedure by cross checking the distribution from the training sample with an independent testing sample. As can be seen in the distributions, these samples agree with eachother.

Additionally, the receiving operator charasterictics for the testing and training samples are shown in \fig{fig:roczutsingletop}.

To include the contribution of the \NPL\ background and the top quark pair FCNC signal, the distributions are evaluated and the multivariate discriminator is constructed. In \fig{fig:bdtSTSRZut}, the normalised distributions of the multivariate discriminator for the \NPL\ background and top quark pair signal is given. The contribution of the top quark pair signal has little effect on the total distribution. The NPL background tends towards the background-like side of the distribution.

\subsection{BDT training in the \TTSR\ for the \Zut\ interaction}
\label{sec:BDTTTSRZUT}
In this region, the BDT is trained against top quark pair and single top signal at the same time. The controbution of the \NPL\ background is again not considered for training. The top quark pair FCNC signal has the largest constribution in this region and the main backgrounds are the \ttZ, \SM\ \tZq, and \WZ+jets processes. In \fig{fig:toppairZutnormalized}, the input variables used to create the multivariate discriminant are shown for the \mumumu\ channel. For the \ttZ\ process, a \PZ\ boson is radiated of one of the top quarks of a top quark pair production process. Hence, there is no top quark reconstructed from a light-flavour jet and \PZ\ boson expected. The invariant mass of the reconstructed FCNC top quark, as well as the distances in the $\phi\eta$ plane between the FCNC light-flavour jet and the \SM\ b jet, as well as between the \PZ\ boson and the FCNC light-flavour jet are used as discriminating variables for this search. For background, the invariant mass of the FCNC top quark is peaking at lower values compared to the signal. Also the distances are peaking at different values. For the same reasons as in the previous sections, pseudorapidity of the SM top quark,  the invariant mass of the \PW\ lepton and the \SM\ b jet, as well as their distance in the $\phi\eta$-plane are considered. Furthermore the difference in $\phi$ between the \PW\ lepton and the \SM\ b jet, as well as its difference in $\phi$ with the reconstructed \PZ\ boson are considered. Furthermore, the minimal distance in the $\phi\eta$-plane between the \PW\ lepton and all the jets is peaking at lower values for signal than for backgrounds. This is due to the fact that for signal this distance will be most likely the distance for the SM b  jet, while for \ttZ\ and \tZq\ this could be, biased through the radiation, and for \WZ+jets this distance will come from FSR jets. Also the number of b-tagged jets according to the CSVv2 medium working point is used in creating the multivariate discriminator, for signal this distributions peaks at one, while for background, this peaks at zero. The invariant mass of the \PZ\ boson is also used. Thought this variable is weak discriminating, this would not harm the training since the BDT can cope with weak variables.  The most important input variables for this region, for the \Zut\ interaction, are the invariant mass of the \PW\ lepton and the \SM\ b jet, as well as their distance. On the third place is the number of b-tagged jets. The distributions for each three-lepton channel separate are given in \App{app:BDTcorrZutTop}.

\subsection{BDT training in the \STSR\ for the \Zct\ interaction}
\label{sec:BDTSTSRZCT}
The input variables used to create the multivariate discriminator in the \STSR\ for the \Zct\ interaction are shown in \fig{fig:singletopZctnormalized}. In analogy to the training for the \Zut\ vertex in the \STSR, the training is performed with the single top quark signal only. The variables discussed in \Sec{sec:BDTSTSRZUT} are used, where the variables related to the charge asymmetry are left out. For charm coupling, both quark and anti-quarks are sea quarks, hence no charge asymmetry is expected. The most important variables are the invariant mass of all leptons,  followed by the CSVv2 discriminator of the jet with the highest \pt, and the invariant mass of the sum of the \PW\ lepton and \SM\ b jet. The distributions for each three-lepton channel separate are given in \App{app:BDTcorrZctSingle}.
The correlations between the different input variables are given in \fig{fig:correlationsigzctsingletop}. The correlations vary from zero to $\sim 55\%$.
The resulting multivariate discriminator D is shown in \fig{fig:sigvsbkgtestzctsingletop} for all three-lepton channels. In these plots one can see that there is a clear discrimination between the FCNC single top quark signal and the backgrounds. Furthermore, one can investigate the procedure by cross checking the distribution from the training sample with an independent testing sample.

\subsection{BDT training in the \TTSR\ for the \Zct\ interaction}
\label{sec:BDTTTSRZCT}
The training in this region for the \Zct\ interaction is done by looking at both signal contributions. The discriminating variables used are shown in \fig{fig:toppairZctnormalized}. Most of the variables are the same as the ones for the \Zut\ interaction. The most important addition is the CSVv2 discriminator value of the FCNC jet. Since here, the FCNC jet is expected to be a charm quark jet, this jet is expected to have a high CSVv2 discriminant. The most important input variables for this region, for the \Zct\ interaction, are the invariant mass of the \PW\ lepton and the \SM\ b jet,  the invariant mass of the FCNC top quark and the reconstructed \PZ\ boson mass. The distributions for each three-lepton channel separate are given in \App{app:BDTcorrZctTop}.
The correlations between the input  variables vary from zero to 55\% (anti) correlation.

The resulting multivariate discriminator D is shown in \fig{fig:sigvsbkgtestzcttoppaire} for all three-lepton channels. In these plots one can see that there is a clear discrimination between the FCNC single top quark signal and the backgrounds. Furthermore, one can investigate the procedure by cross checking the distribution from the training sample with an independent testing sample. As can be seen in the distributions, these samples agree with eachother.

The receiving operator characteristics are shown in \fig{fig:roczcttoppair}.

To include the contribution of the \NPL\ background and the top quark pair FCNC signal, the distributions are evaluated and the multivariate discriminator is constructed.

\section{Transverse mass in \WZCR}
\label{sec:mtw}
The \WZCR\ is used to estimate the contribution from \WZ+jets and \NPL\ background. This region is constructed such that the contribution of the \WZ+jets process is enhanced with respect to the other backgrounds entering the analysis In this region t, a fit is performed on the transverse mass distribution of the \PW\ boson. For the\WZ+jets background, a real \PW\ boson is expected, and the distribution will peak at the mass of the \PW\ boson. For the \NPL\ background, there is no reason for the distribution to peak at the mass of the \PW\ boson. Since the not prompt-leptons in general tend towards lower \pt\ values, their resulting distribution will peak a zero and decrease towards higher values of $m_{\mathrm{T}}(\PW)$.  The normalised distributions are shown in \fig{fig:mtwnorm} for all three-lepton channels. The sum of the lepton channels is shown in \fig{fig:mtwallnorm}.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:sys}
The systematic uncertainties entering the analysis are coming from different sources. The experimental uncertainties arise from the reconstruction of the objects and are discussed in \Sec{sec:PhysicsObject}. These influence the number of events passing the selection, so-called normalisation uncertainties, and/or the relative occupancies of the distributions, so-called shape
 uncertainties. The normalisation uncertainties coming from reconstruction include the uncertainty of 2.5\% on the measured integrated luminosity and the efficiency of the trigger logic used for the analysis which has a 1\% (5\%) uncertainty on the 
 \mumumu\ and \emumu\ (\eemu\ and \eee) channels. The  pileup distribution is calculated via the minimum bias cross section which has a 4.6\% uncertainty. This uncertainty results in a systematic shift in the pileup distribution and its shape effect is estimated by recalculating the pileup distribution for each variation of the minimum bias cross section. The shape uncertainties also include the uncertainties coming from the applied lepton scale factors. Their systematic uncertainty originates from three sources: identification, isolation and tracking.  The uncertainties arising from jet energy corrections require a recalculation of all jet related kinematic observables and its effect is propagated to the missing transverse energy.  The reweighting of the CSVv2 discriminant is also a source of uncertainty. There are three sources of uncertainty contributing to the measurement of the b-tag related scale factors: statistical uncertainties, jet energy scale and the purity of the sample. These result in eight uncorrelated contributions. 
 
 Since the \NPL\ sample is artificially made from data by inverting the isolation of the third lepton. Its effect has to be estimated. The shape uncertainty for the \NPL\ processes is obtained by varying the isolation inversion with respect to relative isolation value for the tight lepton identification and the relative isolation for  the loose lepton identification for electrons and muons at the same time. This found to have negligible effect. Changing the value of the relative isolation has found to have a negligible effect on the shape of the relative distribution occupancies of the \NPL\ background. The uncertainty on the normalisation of the overall \NPL\ yield is taken as 50\% in accordance with the \SM\ \tZq\ search~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-16-020}.
 
 The uncertainty on the expected yield of the simulated backgrounds is taken to be 30\% of the yield such that it covers all uncertainties at next to leading order accuracy. Theory uncertainties  originating from the modelling of the main backgrounds are estimated to account for the effect on the shape of the distributions from the choice of parton density functions, and renormalization (\muR) and factorization (\muF) scales. The effect of the  renormalization (\muR) and factorization (\muF) scales is estimated by varying each independently ($\muR\uparrow$, $\muR\downarrow$, $\muF\uparrow$, or $\muF\downarrow $) and correlated up and down  ($\muR\uparrow\muF\uparrow$ or $\muR\downarrow\muF\downarrow $) by a factor of two. The envelope of these variations is used as an uncertainty. The uncertainties coming from the parton density functions  used for simulation are estimated using the PDF4LHC recipe~\cite{Ball:2017nwa}, which combines the MMHT14, CT14, and NNPDF3.0 PDF sets. The theory uncertainties are considered for the main backgrounds coming from simulation: \WZ+jets, \ZZ+jets, \ttZ, and \tZq. This is found to have a negligible effect.

 The way the uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters is summarized in \tab{tab:nuis}. The effect of systematic uncertainties that are treated as shape uncertainties is shown in \Sec{sec:MTW} and \Sec{sec:BDTsys} . \todo{INCLUDE EFFECT PDF AND FACT/RENO}

\subsection{Effect of systematic uncertainties in \WZCR}
\label{sec:MTW}
The effect of the experimental uncertainties influencing the shape of the distribution of the transverse mass of the \PW\ boson in the \WZCR is shown in this section for the \WZ+jet process by varying each source of uncertainty individually within its uncertainty range. The uncertainties due to pileup and lepton scale factors, shown in \fig{fig:shiftMTW1}, have the smallest effect on the distribution. The uncertainty on the pileup distribution is clearly influencing the shape of the distribution, while the lepton identification uncertainties are more affecting the normalisation of the whole distribution. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:shiftMTW1}
\end{figure}

The effect of the uncertainties arising from the jet energy corrections, shown in \fig{fig:shiftMTW3}),  have the largest effect on the shape of the distribution. The jet energy scale has the most influence on the distribution, affecting both its normalisation and shape. This is due to the fact that the missing transverse energy, which is used for constructing the transverse mass of the \PW\ boson, is influenced by the change in jet energy. Still, for the bulk of the distribution, this effect stays within a 10\% margin.

	\label{fig:shiftMTW3}
\end{figure}

The uncertainties due to b-tagging are shown in \fig{fig:shiftMTW2}. The uncertainty due to purity of heavy flavour jets has the largest contribution and stays within 10\% of the nominal shape. This is due to the fact that events are migrating in and out of the \WZCR, based on the presence of b jets. All The uncertainties due to b-tagging uncertainties are not having an impact on the shape of the distribution since no b-tag information is used to construct the transverse mass of the \PW\ boson.

In \fig{fig:shiftMTWt}, the effect of the theoretical uncertainties uncertainties on the distribution of the \WZ+jets process is shown.

\subsection{Effect of the systematic uncertainties in the signal regions}
\label{sec:BDTsys}
In this section, the effect of the systematic uncertainties on the multivariate discriminator in the \STSR\ involving the \Zut\ vertex is shown for the \WZ+jets background and the signal (\tZ + \tZq). The effect of the systematic uncertainties for the other regions, as well as the \Zct\ coupling, are shown in \App{app:sys}. 

The effect of the uncertainty on the estimation of the pileup distribution is shown in \fig{fig:shiftBDTSTZutPU}. This uncertainty has a small effect on the shape for the background distribution. For the distribution of the signal process, this effect is even smaller.

\section{Limit setting procedure validation}
\label{sec:val}
The analysis strategy has been established using a blinded strategy. This way, one is sure that there is no bias introduced into the analysis. Through the use of a pseudo dataset, the limit setting procedure has been validated. Signal injection tests for which the signal strength from a pseudo dataset with a pre-set  signal strength is estimated are performed and shown in \fig{fig:plotzut}. From these plots, it is clear that for a data set with a signal strength $\mu= 0.1,\;0.2,\;0.3,\;,0.4$ or $0.5$, the maximum likelihood estimate returns the same values. This validation has been done for both the \Zut\ and \Zct\ interaction.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering

	\label{fig:plotzut}
\end{figure}

Another validation has been done by performing a Maximum Likelihood fit in the \WZCR\ only, considering all lepton channels. This validation has been performed to have a validation for the data driven estimation of the \NPL\ yield. A simultaneous fit of the signal strength of the \NPE, \NPM\ and the \WZ+jets backgrounds is done by using the multi-dimensional fit in \texttt{Higgs} \texttt{Combine} \texttt{Tool}. The maximum likelihood estimator of the \NPM\ yield and the one for the \NPE\ are in agreement with eachother. This is expected since both should represent the same sample. The yield of the \WZ+jets is estimated to be 20\% larger than its initial value, which is within its 30\% rate uncertainty. The resulting signal strengths can then be applied on the distribution of the transverse mass of the \PW\ boson to verify data/MC agreement, as can be seen in \fig{fig:mtwstack}. %Furthermore, a goodness of fit test is performed to quantitatively validate the fit.  The resulting  p-value is 0.3 (see \fig{fig:gof} ), which means that it is unlikely to have a  .

\section{Results and discussion}
\label{sec:Result}
The limit setting procedure explained in \Sec{sec:Stat} is applied and results are obtained for each lepton channel separately as well as the combination. For both the \Zut\ and \Zct\ coupling, the maximum likelihood estimator of their signal strengths $\hat{\mu}$ is compatible with zero. This is shown in \fig{fig:mlezut}. One can see that the \eee\ lepton channel has the largest uncertainty. This is due to the fact that this channel is the most influences by the lack of statistics for this search.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\label{fig:mlezut}
\end{figure}

The maximum likelihood estimators for the nuisance parameters $\hat{\theta}$ are shown in \fig{fig:171102zctmle} for the \Zct\ interaction and in the Appendix (\fig{fig:171102zutmle}) for the \Zut\ interaction. Their values obtained from the signal plus background or background only fits are in agreement. The transfer factors have an initial value different than one and have small uncertainties. The normalisation uncertainties on the yields of the simulated backgrounds get constrained by the fit.  %A well known verification of the error coverage for the fit is the pull distribution. For a random variable $x$ following a Gaussian distribution of mean $m$ and width $w$, the pull $g$ is defined as
%\begin{equation}
% g = \frac{x - m}{w},
%\end{equation}
%and follows a standard Gaussian with mean zero and unit width. This property can be applied to our case of parameter estimation due to the central limit theorem~\cite{CDF:AN5776}. The pull distributions are shown in \fig{fig:pulls}. These are peaking at zero with tails going to $\pm2.5$.

%\newpage
 In \fig{fig:impactsZut1} and \fig{fig:impactsZct1}, one can see that the nuisance parameters related to the \NPL\ normalisations are shifted with respect to their initial values. This is to be expected since their initial  normalisation is arbitrary. Furthermore, the effect of the uncertainties on the maximum likelihood estimate of the signal strength is shown. The search is limited by lack of data, as can be seen from \fig{fig:exclusionlimitbrcomp} and \fig{fig:exclusionlimitbrfcnczct}. After the limited data statistics, the most important systematic uncertainty are the \ttZ\ normalisation, JES uncertainty and the \NPL\ normalisation uncertainty.

\subsection{Postfit distributions}
 The distributions of multivariate discriminating  variables as well as the distribution of the transverse mass of the \PW\ boson are recreated with the maximum likelihood estimations of the nuisance parameters. The resulting distributions are shown in \fig{fig:shapesfitALL}, \fig{fig:shapesfit3mu}, \fig{fig:shapesfit1e2mu}, \fig{fig:shapesfit2e1mu}, and \fig{fig:shapesfit3e}. 
 In the \WZCR\ and \TTSR, that have the most events entering in the regions, there is a clear agreement between data and simulation for all three-lepton channels. In the \STSR, there are some jumps due to the fact that the \NPL\ background is made from a limited data sample and does not have a smooth template to fit.

\subsection{Postfit yields}
\label{sec:postfityields}
In \tab{tab:PYieldSTCR} and \tab{tab:PYieldTTCR}, the  event yields for each process after the global fit for the signal involving a \Zut\ vertex is given for respectively the \STCR\ and \TTCR. All background yields are approximately unchanged and the signal is downscaled with factor of 0.2 with respect to its initial yield. In \tab{tab:PYieldWZCR}, the postfit signal yield is consistent with the other control regions. The background contribution of the \NPL\ process has been doubled, resulting in an agreement between data and simulation. The event yields in the signal regions, \STSR\ and \TTSR, are given in \tab{tab:PYieldSTSR} and \tab{tab:PYieldTTSR} respectively. The contributions of the \WZ+jets and \ttZ+jets backgrounds has risen within their uncertainties, and the contribution of the \NPL\ background has increased, making data agree with simulation.

\section{Limits at 95\% CL}
\label{sec:limits}
\subsection{One dimensional limits}

The limit setting procedure used in this search returns  limits on the signal strength modifier which can be translated to signal cross sections. These limits are translated to a limit on the branching fraction using \eq{eq:BR}. Additionally, the limit on the couplings are extracted using the fact that the cross sections are quadratically dependent on the couplings. In  \fig{fig:exclusionlimitbrfcnczut}, the resulting limits at 95\% CL on the branching fraction and couplings related to the \Zut\ vertex is shown. This observed (expected) limit amounts to $\BR < \BRZuto\: (\BRZut)$ when $\kZut \neq 0$ and$ \kZct = 0$.The expected limit surpasses the CMS search at a centre-of-mass of 8 \TeV\ expected limits of 0.027\% \cite{Sirunyan:2017kkr}. The observed limit of  \BRZuto\ for the \Zut\ interaction doesn't surpass the CMS 8~\TeV\ observed limit of 0.022\%~\cite{Sirunyan:2017kkr}. The ATLAS collaboration has set limits 95\% CL at a centre-of-mass of 13~\TeV~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2017-070} with
observed (expected) limits of 0.017\% (0.024\%) for the \Zut\ coupling. The expected limit presented in this analysis surpasses the expected limit for \Zut.

In \fig{fig:exclusionlimitbrcomp} and \tab{tab:ResultsTZU}, the limits for each lepton channel separate as well as their combined limits are shown for the \Zut\ vertex. The lepton channels are in agreement with eachother, where the presence of a muon helps pushing the limit further. The \STSR\ is the most sensitive region because of the higher presence of the targeted single top quark signal. Further, one can see that by combining single top quark and top quark pair signals, one gains in sensitivity.

 In  \fig{fig:exclusionlimitbrfcnczct}, the resulting limits at 95\% CL on the branching fraction and couplings related to the \Zct\ vertex is shown. For this coupling, the observed (expected) limit at 95\% CL is $\BR < \BRZcto\: (\BRZct)$ when $\kZct \neq 0$ and$ \kZut = 0$. The expected limit surpasses the CMS search at a centre-of-mass of 8 \TeV\ expected limits of 0.118\% \cite{Sirunyan:2017kkr}. This also the case for the observed limit of  \BRZcto\ for the \Zct\ interaction, which surpasses the CMS 8~\TeV\ observed limit of 0.049\%~\cite{Sirunyan:2017kkr}. The observed (expected) limit set by the ATLAS collaboration at a centre-of-mass of 13~\TeV~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2017-070} is 0.023\% (0.032\%) for the \Zct\ coupling. The expected limit presented in this analysis is in accordance with this limit.

\subsection{Two-dimensional limits}
One can interpolate the one dimensional limits $\pisces_{\tZq}^{\mathrm{1D}}$ to a scenario where both couplings are on-vanishing. The interpolation is taken from Ref.~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-17-003}, where an experimental extrapolation formulae
\begin{equation}
 \kZct =  \pisces_{\Zct}^{\mathrm{1D}} \sqrt{1 - \frac{\kZut} {\pisces_{\Zut}^{\mathrm{1D}}}}, 
\end{equation}
is found from 100 benchmark scenarios. These scenarios are constructed from existing signal samples as
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{Signal\: yield} = (\kZut)^2 (\mathrm{ST\: tZu \: yield + TT\: tZu \: yield }) + (\kZct)^2 (\mathrm{ST\: tZc \: yield + TT\: tZc \: yield }). 
\end{equation}
For each scenario a dedicated BDT training is performed and the expected limit at 95\% CL are calculated. The resulting two-dimensional limits are shown in \fig{fig:exclusionlimitbrfcnc}.
