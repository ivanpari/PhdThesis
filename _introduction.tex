\chapter{Introduction}

The Standard Model of particle physics is a theory of fundamental particles and how they interact. It is the best theoretical framework so far to describe the nature around us. This theory has been experimentally confirmed and all particles predicted by this theory have been found. However, it has its shortcomings and can not explain phenomena such as neutrino masses or gravity. The top quark is the heaviest particle in the Standard Model and physicists believe that it has an enhanced sensitivity to various new particles and interactions suggested by beyond the Standard Model theories. The top quark has a very short lifetime, so short that it doesn't form bound states and it can be used to study the bare quark. It has a distinct signature since it almost exclusively decays to a \PW\ boson and a bottom quark, making it possible to directly study the top quark properties. Many beyond the Standard Model physics phenomena are researched by measuring the production rate of top quarks for studying the $\PW\Ptop\Pbottom$ vertex. Furthermore, interactions that are heavily suppressed in the Standard Model can be investigated. The Large Hadron Collider is a top quark factory, producing a large number of events containing top quarks. At the proton collision points, experiments are placed to study these collisions. 


 The charged current process, occurring when a charged kaon decaying to muon ($ \mathrm{K}^+ \rightarrow \APmuon \Pnum$) was a well known process at the end of the 1960s. Its counterpart, the neutral current process $ \mathrm{K}^{0}_L \rightarrow \APmuon \Pmuon$ was however not observed, baffling physicists of that time. In the same period, only three different quarks were known and although the existence of a fourth quark was proposed, there was no evidence for it yet. The GIM mechanism~\cite{Maiani:2013fpa}, proposed in 1970, provided a satisfying explanation for the suppression of neutral current processes compared to charged current processes, via a fourth quark with specific couplings to the other quarks . This fourth quark is now known as the strange quark. The GIM mechanism combined with the existing measurements provided already indirect observation of the charm quark before it was directly observed in $J/\Psi$ meson decay~\cite{Aubert:1974js}.  This confirmed that flavour changing neutral currents, that change the flavour of a fermion without altering its electric charge, are highly suppressed in the Standard Model. 

The first evidence for flavour changing neutral currents was provided in 2005 by the CDF experiment~\cite{Acosta:2005eu}, by looking at $B^0_s\rightarrow \phi\phi$ decays. However, the large production rate of \Pbottom\ hadrons at the LHC made it possible for the LHCb and CMS collaboration to measure the FCNC decays of b hadrons~\cite{CMS:2014xfa}. Their combined data  provided the first discovery of FCNC decays with the $B_s^0 \rightarrow\Pmuon\APmuon$ decay. This observation agreed with the Standard Model prediction and has put stringent limits on beyond the Standard Model theories. However, recent reinterpretations in 2015, for bottom to strange quark transitions, have found strong hints for a new physics particle~\cite{Altmannshofer:2013foa}.  Up to this moment,  the searches performed at the Tevatron by the CDF \cite{PhysRevLett.101.192002} and D0 \cite{Abazov:2010qk} collaborations, 
and at the LHC by the ATLAS \cite{Aad:2015uza,Aad:2015gea} and CMS \cite{Sirunyan:2017kkr,Chatrchyan:2013nwa,Khachatryan:2015att,Sirunyan:2017kkr}  collaborations are far from the sensitivity of the Standard Model predictions. This leaves a large phase space to reveal or exclude new physics phenomena.

%Many extensions of the Standard Model induce sizeable flavour changing neutral current interactions, making it a sensitive probe for physics beyond the Standard Model.
%By performing precise measurements of the known decays of hadrons, one can study the processes that occur via the weak force. These are particularly interesting since such decays are possible via virtual transient particles and heavy new particles can  cause large deviations from the Standard Model predications for the decay rates and have an influence the dynamics of the decay products. An effective Lagrangian can be used to describe the effects of such an interaction when the responsible new physics is heavier than the top, making it possible to search for top flavour violating interactions in a model independent way. 
%The first limits on the flavour violating top-quark production is set by the LEP experiments by studying the process $\Pep\Pem\rightarrow \Ptop\Pquark$, which is sensitive to the $\Ptop\Pgamma\Pup$ and $\Ptop\PZ\Pup$ couplings \todocite. Also at HERA, the same vertices were studied. The hadron colliders are able to investigate all top FCNC couplings and the anomalous single top quark production as well as the top quark pair production with an anomalous decay have been performed both at Tevatron \todocite, as well as the LHC. 



The search presented in this thesis is performed on data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 \TeV, resulting in 35.9 \fbinv\ of integrated luminosity. The coupling of a \PZ\ boson to a top quark and an up or charm quark are being investigated for three lepton signatures. In the Standard Model, the branching fraction for a top quark decaying into a charm or up quark and a \PZ\ boson of the order of $10^{-14}$ \cite{AguilarSaavedra:2004wm,PhysRevD.2.1285}. Several extensions of the Standard Model however enhance the \FCNC\ branching fractions and can be probed at the LHC \cite{AguilarSaavedra:2004wm} and provide interactions resulting in flavour changing single top quark production through a tZq vertex.  The first chapter of this thesis introduces the Standard Model of particle physics as well as a brief introduction into effective field theories. The end of this chapter focusses on flavour changing neutral currents involving top-Z-quark interactions and gives an overview of the current experimental limits.  The second chapter gives a description of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, as well as the CMS experiment. Its coordinate system, hardware and data acquisition are discussed. The analysis techniques used for the search  presented in this thesis are discussed in the third chapter. Here, the simulation of proton collisions is explained.  Additionally, an introduction is given to Boosted Decision Trees as well as the statistical methodology used for the search. In the fourth chapter, the reconstruction and identification of particles within CMS is explained. At the end, an overview is given of the corrections that one needs to apply for making the simulation agree with data. The event selection and categorisation used for the search are explained in the fifth chapter. Here the analysis strategy is set and the statistical independent regions are defined. Chapter six the templates that are used for the limits are discussed and the results are presented. The final chapter concludes the search and an outlook to the future is given.
