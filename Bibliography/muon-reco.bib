  abstract={The performance of muon reconstruction, identification, and triggering in CMS has been studied using 40 pb −1 of data collected in pp collisions at √ s = 7 TeV at the LHC in 2010. A few benchmark sets of selection criteria covering a wide range of physics analysis needs have been examined. For all considered selections, the efficiency to reconstruct and identify a muon with a transverse momentum p T larger than a few GeV/c is above 95% over the whole region of pseudorapidity covered by the CMS muon system, |η| < 2.4, while the probability to misidentify a hadron as a muon is well below 1%. The efficiency to trigger on single muons with p T above a few GeVc is higher than 90% over the full η range, and typically substantially better. The overall momentum scale is measured to a precision of 0.2% with muons from Z decays. The transverse momentum resolution varies from 1% to 6% depending on pseudorapidity for muons with p T below 100GeV/c and, using cosmic rays, it is shown to be better than 10% in the central region up to p T = 1 TeV/c. Observed distributions of all quantities are well reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation.}
