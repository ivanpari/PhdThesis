  abstract={The CMS simulation, based on the Geant4 toolkit, has been operational within the new CMS software framework for more than four years. The description of the detector including the forward regions has been completed and detailed investigation of detector positioning and material budget has been carried out using collision data. Detailed modeling of detector noise has been performed and validated with the collision data. In view of the high luminosity runs of the Large Hadron Collider, simulation of pile-up events has become a key issue. Challenges have raised from the point of view of providing a realistic luminosity profile and modeling of out-of-time pileup events, as well as computing issues regarding memory footprint and IO access. These will be especially severe in the simulation of collision events for the LHC upgrades; a new pileup simulation architecture has been introduced to cope with these issues. The CMS detector has observed anomalous energy deposit in the calorimeters and there has been a substantial effort to understand these anomalous signal events present in the collision data. Emphasis has also been given to validation of the simulation code including the physics of the underlying models of Geant4. Test beam as well as collision data are used for this purpose. Measurements of mean response, resolution, energy sharing between the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, shower shapes for single hadrons are directly compared with predictions from Monte Carlo. A suite of performance analysis tools has been put in place and has been used to drive several optimizations to allow the code to fit the constraints posed by the CMS computing model.}

		abstract={During LHC shutdown between run-1 and run-2 intensive developments were carried out to improve performance of CMS simulation. For physics improvements migration from Geant4 9.4p03 to Geant4 10.0p02 has been performed. CPU performance has been improved by introduction of the Russian roulette method inside CMS calorimeters, optimization of CMS simulation sub-libraries, and usage of statics build of the simulation executable. As a result of these efforts, CMS simulation has been speeded up by about factor two. In this work we provide description of updates for different software components of CMS simulation. Development of a multi-threaded (MT) simulation approach for CMS will be also discuss.}
